Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiNamespaceLookupFailure: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [
0.035659] ACPI Error: [USBC] Namespace lookup failure, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
(20160422/dswload-378)

ADVICE: This is a bug picked up by the kernel, but as yet, the firmware test
suite has no diagnostic advice for this particular problem.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiNamedObjLookupFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [
0.035663] ACPI Exception: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, During name lookup/catalog
(20160422/psobject-227)

ADVICE: The ACPI driver failed to find an object while parsing a named Op, see
acpi_ps_build_named_op().

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiTableLoadFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.035728]
ACPI Exception: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, (SSDT:RV11Rtd3) while loading table (20160422
/tbxfload-227)

ADVICE: ACPI was unable to load an ACPI table, an ACPI exception occurred trying
to load it

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiTableLoadFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.053777]
ACPI Error: 1 table load failures, 10 successful (20160422/tbxfload-247)

ADVICE: ACPI was unable to load one or more ACPI tables

Kernel message: [ 0.057343] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.193154] ACPI: [Firmware Bug]: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Found 4 unique errors in kernel log.

PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device7 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device5 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device1 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and

PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device4 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device2 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device0 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device7 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device5 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device8 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device6 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiNamespaceLookupFailure: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [
0.035659] ACPI Error: [USBC] Namespace lookup failure, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
(20160422/dswload-378)

ADVICE: This is a bug picked up by the kernel, but as yet, the firmware test
suite has no diagnostic advice for this particular problem.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiNamedObjLookupFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [
0.035663] ACPI Exception: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, During name lookup/catalog
(20160422/psobject-227)

ADVICE: The ACPI driver failed to find an object while parsing a named Op, see
acpi_ps_build_named_op().

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiTableLoadFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.035728]
ACPI Exception: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, (SSDT:RV11Rtd3) while loading table (20160422
/tbxfload-227)

ADVICE: ACPI was unable to load an ACPI table, an ACPI exception occurred trying
to load it

FAILED [HIGH] KlogAcpiTableLoadFailed: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.053777]
ACPI Error: 1 table load failures, 10 successful (20160422/tbxfload-247)

ADVICE: ACPI was unable to load one or more ACPI tables

Kernel message: [ 0.057343] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.193154] ACPI: [Firmware Bug]: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Found 4 unique errors in kernel log.

Kernel message: [ 0.057343] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.193154] ACPI: [Firmware Bug]: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

maxreadreq: Test firmware has set PCI Express MaxReadReq to a higher value on
non-motherboard devices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Test firmware settings MaxReadReq for PCI Express devices.
MaxReadReq for 0000:00:02.0 is low (128).
FAILED [LOW] LowMaxReadReq: Test 1, 1 devices have low MaxReadReq settings.
Firmware may have configured these too low.

ADVICE: The MaxReadRequest size is set too low and will affect performance. It
will provide excellent bus sharing at the cost of bus data transfer rates.
Although not a critical issue, it may be worth considering setting the
MaxReadRequest size to 256 or 512 to increase throughput on the PCI Express bus.
Some drivers (for example the Brocade Fibre Channel driver) allow one to
override the firmware settings. Where possible, this BIOS configuration setting
is worth increasing it a little more for better performance at a small reduction
of bus sharing.

aspm: PCIe ASPM test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: PCIe ASPM ACPI test.
PCIe ASPM is not controlled by Linux kernel.

ADVICE: BIOS reports that Linux kernel should not modify ASPM settings that BIOS
configured. It can be intentional because hardware vendors identified some
capability bugs between the motherboard and the add-on cards.


Test 2 of 2: PCIe ASPM registers test.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 0000h:00h:1Ch.03h L0s not enabled.
WARNING: Test 2, Device 0000h:03h:00h.00h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increase power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

PASSED: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting matched was matched.
WARNING: Test 2, Device 0000h:04h:00h.00h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increase power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

FAILED [MEDIUM] PCIEASPM_Unmatched: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting was not matched.
RP 0000h:00h:1Ch.06h has ASPM = 03h.
Device 0000h:04h:00h.00h has ASPM = 02h.

ADVICE: ASPM control registers between root port and device must match in order
for ASPM to be active. Unmatched configuration indicates software did not
configure ASPM correctly and the system is not saving power at its full
potential.

WARNING: Test 2, RP 0000h:00h:1Ch.00h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit

by http://www.microsoft.com/taiwan/whdc/archive/pciirq.mspx and described in
pages 233-238 of PCI System Architecture, Fourth Edition, Mindshare, Inc.
(1999). NOTE: The PCI IRQ Routing Table only really knows about ISA IRQs and is
generally not used with APIC. 

Could not find PCI IRQ Routing Table. Since this table is for legacy BIOS
systems which don't have ACPI support this is generally not a problem.

mpcheck: MultiProcessor Tables tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

Failed to find the Multiprocessor Table data, skipping mpcheck test.
NOTE: Since the ACPI MADT is being used instead for SMP configuration, this is
not a problem.
